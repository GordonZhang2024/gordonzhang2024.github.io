<p>I am excited to introduce my latest project - tkMarker. tkMarker is an open-source Markdown editor written in Python and tkinter, designed to provide users with an efficient and visually pleasing editing experience. It uses the MIT License.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>tkMarker is a Markdown editor that focuses on user experience, with the following features:</p>
<p><strong>Fast Speed:</strong> tkMarker adopts efficient algorithms and optimization strategies to ensure you can smoothly edit and preview Markdown documents without waiting. Tested under extremely slow disk read/write speeds, tkMarker still launches within 2 seconds, while other similar products (such as apostrophe) require 10 seconds.
<strong>Clean and Beautiful Interface:</strong> We focus on the design of the user interface. tkMarker's interface is clean and beautiful, without redundant functions, allowing you to focus on writing.
<strong>Real-time Preview:</strong> You can instantly view the rendering effect of Markdown text in tkMarker's real-time preview window, making it easy to adjust and modify.
<strong>Custom Themes Support:</strong> In the future, tkMarker will provide various built-in themes and also support user-customized themes, allowing you to customize the appearance of the editor according to your personal preferences.
<strong>Lightweight:</strong> tkMarker is a lightweight Markdown editor (only 700 lines of core code). Its markdown preview uses your browser instead of embedding a browser window in the page (which would make it very large), meaning its Markdown preview speed is very fast.</p>
<p><strong>How to Use</strong></p>
<p>Using tkMarker is very simple, just follow these steps:</p>
