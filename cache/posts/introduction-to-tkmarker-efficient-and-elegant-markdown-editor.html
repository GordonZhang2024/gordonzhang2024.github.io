<p>I am excited to introduce my latest project - tkMarker. tkMarker is an open-source Markdown editor written in Python and tkinter, aimed at providing users with an efficient and visually pleasing editing experience. It utilizes the MIT License.</p>
<section id="introduction">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>tkMarker is a Markdown editor focused on enhancing user experience, featuring:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Fast Speed: tkMarker employs efficient algorithms and optimization strategies to ensure smooth editing and previewing of Markdown documents. Even tested under extremely slow disk read/write speeds, tkMarker still launches within 2 seconds, outperforming similar products like apostrophe, which require 10 seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean and Beautiful Interface: We pay attention to the design of the user interface. tkMarker's interface is clean and beautiful, without unnecessary functions, allowing users to concentrate on writing.</p></li>
<li><p>Real-time Preview: Users can instantly view the rendering effect of Markdown text in tkMarker's real-time preview window, facilitating easy adjustments and modifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Custom Themes Support: In future updates, tkMarker will offer various built-in themes and support for user-customized themes, allowing users to personalize the editor's appearance according to their preferences.</p></li>
<li><p>Lightweight: tkMarker is a lightweight Markdown editor, consisting of only 700 lines of core code. Its Markdown preview uses the browser instead of embedding a browser window in the page, ensuring very fast preview speeds.</p></li>
</ul>
